	abstract         = "The crystal lattice of single-crystal silicon gives rise to anisotropic elasticity. The stiffness and compliance coefficient matrix depend on crystal orientation and, consequently, Young&#39;s modulus, the shear modulus and Poisson&#39;s ratio as well. Computer codes (in Matlab and Python) have been developed to calculate these anisotropic elasticity parameters for a silicon crystal in any orientation. These codes facilitate the evaluation of these anisotropy effects in silicon for applications such as microelectronics, microelectromechanical systems and X-ray optics. For mechanically bent X-ray optics, it is shown that the silicon crystal orientation is an important factor which may significantly influence the optics design and manufacturing phase. Choosing the appropriate crystal orientation can both lead to improved performance whilst lowering mechanical bending stresses. The thermal deformation of the crystal depends on Poisson&#39;s ratio. For an isotropic constant Poisson&#39;s ratio, [nu], the thermal deformation (RMS slope) is proportional to (1 + [nu]). For a cubic anisotropic material, the thermal deformation of the X-ray optics can be approximately simulated by using the average of [nu]12 and [nu]13 as an effective isotropic Poisson&#39;s ratio, where the direction 1 is normal to the optic surface, and the directions 2 and 3 are two normal orthogonal directions parallel to the optical surface. This average is independent of the direction in the optical surface (the crystal plane) for Si(100), Si(110) and Si(111). Using the effective isotropic Poisson&#39;s ratio for these orientations leads to an error in thermal deformation smaller than 5.5%.",

The method utilizes multiple angular scans across the Bragg peak (rocking curve) at various vertical positions of a narrow-gap slit downstream from the monochromator. When increasing the beam power, the surface of the liquid-nitrogen-cooled silicon crystal deforms from a concave shape at low heat load to a convex shape at high heat load, passing through an approximately flat shape at intermediate heat load. Finite-element analysis is used to calculate the crystal thermal deformations. The simulated crystal profiles and slopes are in excellent agreement with experiments.

The second method derives the variation of the single electron spectral-angular distribution with respect to the electron direction and the electron energy, and simulates the rays emitted by each electron.

Water plays a fundamental role in the interactions between indigo and clay. The dynamics of the clay&#39;s zeolitic and structural water molecules during the formation of MB, usually stabilized by moderate heating, has been monitored by means of neutron inelastic scattering. Neutron incoherent scattering in these samples is only due to the hydrogen atoms, so the signal is very sensitive to the amount of released water, providing detailed information on the dehydration process. A simultaneous analysis of the coherent elastic scattering and the incoherent scattering allows observing and quantifying how the structure of the clay is affected by dehydration.

Meter sized plasmas are diagnosed with cm spatial resolution and 10 ms time resolution. This concept can also be used as a diagnostic of small sources, such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF) plasmas and targets on x-ray light source beam lines, with spatial resolution of microns. A new concept of using matched pairs of spherically bent crystals for monochromatic stigmatic 2D x-ray imaging of mm sized sources offers the possibility of spatial resolution of microns and large solid angle, relative to that achieved with pinhole imaging. Other potential applications of the 2D imaging schemes include x-ray lithography and x-ray microscopy for biological and materials science research. Measurements from MFE plasmas, as well as laboratory experiments and ray tracing computations validating the 1D imaging spectroscopy and 2D x-ray imaging techniques will be presented.",

Ideal trioctahedral (y = 1) palygorskite is elusive, although sepiolite Mg8Si12O30(OH)4(OH2)4 with a similar composition, three-chain ribbon structure and distinct XRD pattern is common. A set of 22 samples identified by XRD as palygorskite and with variable composition (0 &#60; x &#60; 0.7, 0 &#60; y &#60; 0.5) were studied to extrapolate the structure of an ideal trioctahedral (y = 1) palygorskite and to compare this structure to sepiolite. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to study the influence of octahedral composition on the structure of the TOT ribbons, H2O in the tunnels and surface silanols of palygorskite, as well as their response to loss of zeolitic H2O. All spectroscopic evidence suggests that palygorskite consists of discrete dioctahedral and trioctahedral entities. The dioctahedral entities have variable structure determined solely by x = FeIII/(Al+FeIII) and their content is proportional to (1-y). In contrast, the trioctahedral entities have fixed octahedral composition or ribbon structure and are spectroscopically identical to sepiolite. The value of d200 in palygorskite follows the regression d200 (&#197;) = 6.362 + 0.129 x(1- y) + 0.305 y, R2 = 0.96, ? = 0.013 &#197;. When extrapolated to y = 1, d200 is identical to sepiolite. Based on this analysis, we propose that palygorskite samples with non-zero trioctahedral character should be considered as members of a polysomatic series of sepiolite and (dioctahedral) palygorskite described by the new formula y?Mg8Si12O30(OH)4(OH2)4(1-y?)[x?Mg2Fe2(1-x?)Mg2Al2]Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4, with 0 &#60; x?= x &#60; 0.7 and 0 &#60; y? = y/(2-y) &#60; 0.33.",

Morphology SEM analyses led to classify the sepiolites into several groups, beyond the two simple macroscopic or clay groups. X-ray powder diffraction with synchrotron light was used to discuss the variability of the a and b cell parameters with the nature of the cations and occupancy of the octahedral shell. Rietveld refinement using the ideal sepiolite model is performed on sepiolites at two temperatures: 225 {degrees}C (for zeolitically dehydrated sepiolite) and 25 {degrees}C (for hydrated ambient sepiolite). The latter permitted to locate ca. six molecules of the zeolitic H2O within the tunnels. A few samples were selected to evaluate the feasibility and potential of single-crystal diffraction methods: X-ray microdiffraction and electron diffraction. The macroscopic sepiolites gave well-structured and rich X-ray fiber diffraction patterns, in excellent agreement with ab initio simulations. High-quality single-crystal electron diffraction patterns for three axis zones are indexed and compared with simulations. The experimental and modeling results for X-ray microdiffraction and electron diffraction open a new path for quantitative crystallography on sepiolite and other fibrous clays from the sepiolite-palygorskite group.",

The advantages and limitations of each wave optics method are discussed.

This technique is being further developed for diagnosis of High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) plasmas at laser-plasma facilities and synchrotron/x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities. Useful spatial resolution (micron scale) of such small-scale plasma sources requires magnification, because of the finite pixel size of x-ray CCD detectors (13.5 &mu;m). A von-Hamos like spectrometer using spherical crystals is capable of magnification, as well as uniform sagittal focusing across the full x-ray spectrum, and is being tested in laboratory experiments using a tungsten-target microfocus (5-10 &mu;m) x-ray tube and 13-&mu;m pixel x-ray CCD. A spatial resolution better than 10 &mu;m has been demonstrated. Good spectral resolution is indicated by small differences (0.02 &ndash; 0.1 eV) of measured line widths with best available published natural line widths. Progress and status of HEDP measurements and the physics basis for these diagnostics are presented. A new type of x-ray crystal spectrometer with a convex spherically bent crystal is also reported. The status of testing of a 2D imaging microscope using matched pairs of spherical crystals with x rays will also be presented.

Monte Carlo computer simulation represents the most accurate method of dose calculation in patient geometries and is best suited for the purpose of TPS verification. A Monte Carlo model of the ID17 biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility has been developed, including recent modifications, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit interfaced with the SHADOW X-ray optics and ray-tracing libraries. The code was benchmarked by simulating dose profiles in water-equivalent phantoms subject to irradiation by broad-beam (without spatial fractionation) and microbeam (with spatial fractionation) fields, and comparing against those calculated with a previous model of the beamline developed using the PENELOPE code. Validation against additional experimental dose profiles in water-equivalent phantoms subject to broad-beam irradiation was also performed. Good agreement between codes was observed, with the exception of out-of-field doses and toward the field edge for larger field sizes. Microbeam results showed good agreement between both codes and experimental results within uncertainties. Results of the experimental validation showed agreement for different beamline configurations. The asymmetry in the out-of-field dose profiles due to polarization effects was also investigated, yielding important information for the treatment planning process in MRT.

The thickness of the coating is well below 1&mu;m (tens or hundreds of nanometers). The high aspect ratio ($\sim$10$\sp 7$) between the size of the optics and the thickness of the multilayer can lead to a huge number of elements ($\sim$10$\sp 16$) for the numerical simulation (by finite-element analysis using ANSYS code). In this work, the finite-element model for thermal-structural analysis of multilayer optics has been implemented using the ANSYS layer-functioned elements. The number of meshed elements is considerably reduced and the number of sub-layers feasible for the present computers is increased significantly. Based on this technique, single-layer coated mirrors and multilayer monochromators cooled by water or liquid nitrogen are studied with typical parameters of heat-load, cooling and geometry. The effects of cooling-down of the optics and heating of the X-ray beam are described. It is shown that the influences from the coating on temperature and deformation are negligible. However, large stresses are induced in the layers due to the different thermal expansion coefficients between the layer and the substrate materials, which is the critical issue for the survival of the optics. This is particularly true for the liquid-nitrogen cooling condition. The material properties of thin multilayer films are applied in the simulation to predict the layer thermal stresses with more precision.",

	abstract         = "The ANAELU program is part of the current trend towards 2D diffraction patterns processing. ANAELU is open source, distributed under MPL license. The basic conception of the program is that the user proposes the crystalline structure of the phase under study and the inverse pole figure of the considered texture. With this data, using the tools of mathematical texture analysis, the program simulates and graphically represents the 2D-XRD pattern of the model sample. An important feature of the considered patterns is the distribution of intensities along the Debye rings. The visual comparison between observed and calculated patterns is the criterion of correctness of the proposed model. The program has been successfully used in the characterization of materials for electronic applications, alloys and minerals. Some limitations that have been detected in the use of ANAELU are the limited number of input formats that it is able to read, the program relative slowness, the non-consideration of the diffraction background and the poor portability. The present update consists in the improvement of the raised aspects. ANAELU-2.0 presents the following innovations. (a) A new GUI has been created, in WxPython, associated with a system for reading experimental patterns through the FabIO library. The current system reads patterns in the most internationally used formats. (b) The calculation of diffraction patterns, from the generation of the unit cell to the diffracted intensities, has been translated to FORTRAN 2003 with systematic use of the CRYSFML library. This change reduces the running time by one order. (c) Various routines (Laplacian softening, spherical harmonics) have been introduced to model the two-dimensional background. (d) The current version, ANAELU2.0, can be distributed by means of stable executable packages in Windows, LINUX and IOS wraped by MiniConda.",

OASYS (OrAnge SYnchrotron Suite) is an open-source graphical environment for beamline simulation software designed for that purpose, to perform virtual synchrotron experiments in an efficient, elegant and precise way.The OASYS environment provides not only an intuitive and very-easy-to-use graphical interface, but also high flexibility and rapidity for interactive simulations. It allows to quickly define and compare multiple configurations in the same workspace to permit optimizing an X-ray instrument.OASYS integrates in a synergetic way the most powerful open-source calculation engines available. It interfaces widely used simulation tools for X-ray Optics (e.g. SHADOW for ray tracing, and SRW for wave optics) that are complemented with new tools. OASYS provides a mechanism to communicate among the different packages by sending and receiving encapsulated data. The final goal of the OASYS platform is the integration of different packages to completely model synchrotron virtual experiment, retrieving the parameters of the electron beam, calculating the radiation from magnetic structure, then transporting and optimizing the photon beam and eventually including models for interaction with materials to get instrumental functions, study analyzers and detectors and perform ab-initio simulations to support experimental data analysis.

Several methodologies with increasing complexity are applied to discuss the relevant parameters that quantify the beamline performance. Parameters such as flux, dimensions and intensity distribution of the focused beam, and coherence properties are obtained from simple analytical calculations to sophisticated computer simulations using ray-tracing and wave optics techniques. A latest-generation X-ray nanofocusing beamline for coherent applications (ID16A at the ESRF) has been chosen to study in detail the issues related to highly demagnifying synchrotron sources and exploiting the beam coherence. The performance of the beamline is studied for two storage rings: the old ESRF-1 (emittance 4000pm) and the new ESRF-EBS (emittance 150pm). In addition to traditional results in terms of flux and beam sizes, an innovative study on the partial coherence properties based on the propagation of coherent modes is presented. The different algorithms and methodologies are implemented in the software suite OASYS. These are discussed with emphasis placed upon the their benefits and limitations of each.",
