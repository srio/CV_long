The crystal macroscopic properties are determined by its microscopic structure. Our aim is to study the crystal internal structure and correlate it with the crystal optical behavior. We studied the texture of the crystal, in particular its spatial homogeneity, for different samples using X-ray diffraction topography. The experiment was performed at the ESRF beamline BM5 using a laminar 18 keV monochromatic beam. Several samples supplied by different manufacturers have been studied. Images of (002) reflected beam have been acquired at the Bragg angle for each sample, using a phosphor coated CCD digital detector. Contrast profiles have been obtained, and exponential fits has been performed allowing to deduce the secondary extinction coefficient. It has been found that some samples are quite perfect and the results agree with ideally imperfect crystals model. Other samples present well defined granular macrostructures (with dimensions of tens of microns) superposed to the well-known Gaussian-like crystallite distribution. The different behavior between different samples should be explained in terms of sample internal structure, which is also related to the different graphitization process used by manufacturers."}

We compared the measurements to the SODART- mirrors from the SRG telescope mission program. The surface scatter measurement of the thermally slumped glass substrates yields Half Power Diameters (HPD&#39;s) of single- bounce mirrors of full-illuminated lengths of approximately 40 arcseconds for typical substrates and as low as approximately 10 arcseconds for the best substrates, whereas the SODART mirrors yields HPD&#39;s of approximately 80 arcseconds with very little variation. Both free-standing glass substrates and prototype mounted and multilayer-coated optics were tested. The result demonstrate that the surface scatter contribution, plus any contribution from the mounting procedure, to the Half Power Diameter from a telescope using the slumped glass optics will be in the subarcminute range.In addition we measured low surface microroughness, yielding high reflectivity, from the glass substrates, as well as from the depth graded W/Si multilayer-coated glass.",

It is demonstrated how slope errors with characteristic periodicity between 1 and ca. 1/20 of the mirror length can affect the focal spot shape, size and position. In particular, they can create structures or satellites in the focal spot. The distortions from the ideal shape are generated by the polishing process itself and are intrinsic to each single mirror.

In this paper we summarize the theory of Zachariasen for flat crystals, the multi- lamellar approximation for bent crystals and the Penning-Polder approximation for bent Laue crystals. Some examples of their results are presented. Another method to calculate the diffraction profile consists in solving the Takagi-Taupin equations. The finite difference method, that provides a numerical solution of these equations, is briefly discussed. A new method for solving numerically these equations using the finite element method is proposed. This method is very flexible, because it can consider a crystal with an arbitrary shape and cover the case of critical regime (i.e., inhomogeneities and deformations) with fine elements. In addition, it can couple naturally the diffraction calculation with thermal or mechanical crystal deformations. These deformations are generally induced by the X-ray beam (heat load), the crystal bender (mechanical stress) or are intrinsic to the crystal (inhomogeneities, impurities, dislocations, etc.). An example of the feasibility of this method is shown.",

Test experiments were carried out to demonstrate the high spatial resolution using the incoherent soft X-ray radiation produced by laser- and X-pinch plasmas. Both experimental and theoretical results show that a spatial resolution of at least 4 mu m can be obtained in a field of view ranging from a few mm to cm. The narrow spectral band of the diffracted beam ( Delta lambda / lambda ~3.10/sup -4/), the high efficiency of the presented scheme and the possibility of significantly reducing the self radiation of the studied object make it one of the most promising backlighting systems.

All programs are provided to the user under a unified GUI, which greatly simplifies their execution. The XOP optics applications (especially mirror calculations) take their basic input (optical constants, compound and mixture tables) from a flexible file-oriented database, which allows the user to select data from a large number of choices and also to customize their own data sets. XOP includes many mathematical and visualization capabilities. It also permits the combination of reflectivities from several mirrors and filters, and their effect, onto a source spectrum. This feature is very useful when calculating thermal load on a series of optical elements. The XOP interface is written in the IDL (interactive data language). An embedded version of XOP, which freely runs under most Unix platforms (HP, Sun, Dec, Linux, etc) and under Windows95 and NT, is available upon request."}

The infrared radiation extracted from a bending magnet under an angle of 50*50 mrad will be two orders of magnitude more brilliant than that of a black body at 2000 K at a wavelength of 100 mu m. The beamline layout, which consists of two planar mirrors, two toroidal mirrors and one aspherical mirror, has been designed by ray tracing simulation. In this layout one ellipsoid focuses the radiation on a wedged CVD diamond-film window, the beam is then re-focused again on the entrance of an interferometer. With a calculated transmittance of the optics between 60% and 80% at 50 mu m, this beamline will allow experiments which require a very high brilliance in the far infrared."}

The observed rocking curves were slightly broadened due to nonuniform defect distributions present in the crystals. No heat-load-induced broadening was found. The measured reflectivities compared well to the calculated values, and it was shown that a double-crystal Bragg monochromator can replace a single- reflection Laue monochromator without loss in flux."}

The resulting multireflection profiles can be calculated in a first approximation by the dynamical theory of diffraction, where usually only coherent scattering is considered. In addition, there is experimental evidence of incoherent Compton scattering (ICS) and thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) contributions. Such contributions are especially important when performing small angle scattering experiments where intensities in an interval of ten orders of magnitude are often recorded. We propose and analyze here the use of thin (a few micrometers) crystals for a Bonse-Hart camera in order to decrease the TDS and ICS components, thus to increase the performances of the device. However, using thin crystals causes the occurrence of interference (Pendellosung) fringes which degrades the instrument resolution. We study in this paper the possible elimination of Pendellosung fringes by angularly offsetting one or more crystals with respect to the others. Optimizing the offset value, the Pendellosung oscillations of the crystals interfere destructively, then significantly reducing their contribution to the total resolution function.",

These patterns also produce an oscillating value of the integrated intensity as a function of photon energy. The thickness of the crystal can be adjusted to optimize its optical performance for a given energy range. We analyze different examples of thickness optimization for such crystals.

Diamond in particular is an attractive monochromator as it is rather X-ray transparent and can be fabricated to a high degree of crystal perfection. Moreover, it has a very high heat conductivity and a rather small thermal expansion so the beam X-ray heat load problem is easily overcome.

Ray tracing codes, such as SHADOW, are very efficient in the design and development of new optical devices. In order to determine the convenience of using asymmetrically cut crystals for X-ray monochromators, SHADOW has been extended to include these kinds of crystals. The physical approach to ray tracing asymmetrically cut crystals is based on the coexistence of two periodic structures. One of these is the bulk periodic structure of the Bragg planes. Such a structure determines the existence of a rocking curve near the Bragg condition, and is implemented in SHADOW following the Darwin-Prins formalism of the dynamical theory of diffraction. The second periodic structure is a one-dimensional grating on the crystal surface, formed by the truncation of the lattice planes with the surface. This grating is responsible for the focusing properties of these crystals and plays an essential role in determining the trajectory of the rays. The combination of an asymmetric crystal and a nonplanar surface can be easily achieved by bending (Johann case) to provide improved properties. More complex cases such as the ground- bent crystals (i.e., Johansson geometry) can be considered as a particular case of asymmetrical crystals in which the angle between the Bragg planes and the surface change along the crystal surface. All these cases have been implemented in SHADOW.",

The effect of the random distribution of the crystallites in a mosaic crystal can be analyzed efficiently with a Monte Carlo method. Taking into account the random distribution of the crystal planes, modeled as a Gaussian of standard deviation kappa , it is possible to reproduce the well known focusing and defocusing properties of these crystals. For reflectivity calculations the authors have implemented in the computer code the mosaic crystals theory of Zachariasen.

To optimize their design, it is important to understand the combined effect of focusing and diffraction of the flux available at the sample. The combined effect of focusing and diffraction were examd. for a double-crystal monochromator which is being designed for the Superconducting Wiggler beamline (SCOW) on the ADONE storage ring in Frascati. A double-sepd. crystal system was chosen; the possibility was studied of obtaining focalization in 2 steps, by dynamically bending the crystals to obtain both tangential and sagittal focusing. Nonfocusing and semifocusing systems were also considered. The calcns. were performed with the ray tracing program SHADOW. Performances were estd. for various focusing geometries and the effect was considered of anticlastic curvature. [on SciFinder (R)]"}

Cerium atoms, which are in mixed valence state in the alloys, change their valence with the hydrogen content up to an integer 3+ value, when x = 3.75.
