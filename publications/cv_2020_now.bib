An interesting question, which has barely been considered until the moment to explain the difficulty of the resolution of its structure, is whether the fibrous morphology of palygorskite might enhance the presence of possibly oriented fibers which could influence some reflections in random powder diffraction experiments. To observe this influence of orientation, computer simulations considering a slight variation of the structural models proposed by Chisholm (1992) were performed. These simulations were added in different proportions to study the role that certain proportions of oriented fibers play in the resulting diffractograms. The most interesting changes are in the region of interest comprised between 4.5 and 4.0&#226;ŻĂ. Different contents in the two palygorskite phases with oriented components were also considered, affecting the resulting simulated diffractograms. The simulations were compared with experimental results, concluding that orientation can play a very important role in the diffractograms, therefore complicating even more the resolution of the structure of this mineral.",

The accuracy of the algorithm is proved by reconstructing the full undulator radiation distribution through an aperture and comparing the result with direct calculaton of the total power using SRW. The algorithm is particularly suited to analyze cases with complex beamline layouts and optical elements, such as crystals, multilayers, and compound refractive lenses.

A variety of scenarios to cope with thermal distortion in the first mirror are studied by finite-element analysis. The degradation of the intensity distribution at the focal plane is analyzed and the adaptive optics that correct it is modeled. The range of correctable wavefront errors across the operating range of the beamlines is reported in terms of mirror curvature and spatial frequencies.

Using finite-element analysis, height profiles of the crystal surface for various heat loads and the corresponding slope errors in the meridional and sagittal planes were calculated. Then the angular distortions of the reflected beam in both meridional and sagittal planes were calculated analytically and also modelled by ray tracing, revealing a good agreement of the two approaches. The results show that with increasing heat load in the crystal the slope errors of the crystal surface reach their smallest values first in the sagittal and then in the meridional plane. For the considered case of interest at a photon energy of 14.412keV and the Si(111) reflection with a Bragg angle of 7.88$&#176;$, the angular distortions of the reflected beam in the sagittal plane are an order of magnitude smaller than in the meridional one. Furthermore, they are smaller than the typical angular size of the beam source at the monochromator position. For a high-heat-load monochromator operating in the horizontal scattering plane, the sagittal angular distortions of the reflected beam appear in the vertical plane. Thus, such an instrument perfectly preserves the high quality of the X-ray beam in the vertical plane for downstream optics. Compared with vertical scattering, the throughput of the monochromatic beam with the horizontal scattering plane is reduced by only 3.3% for the new EBS source, instead of 34.3% for the old ESRF-1 machine. This identifies the horizontal-scattering high-heat-load monochromator as a device essentially free of the heat-load effects in the vertical plane and without significant loss in terms of throughput.",
