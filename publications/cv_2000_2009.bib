Indigo presents a strong attachment with palygorskite and sepiolite in contrast to a weak attachment to planar clays (montomorillonite and kaolinite). Cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric data provide estimates of the variation of the concentration of indigo and dehydroindigo with the depth on clay crystals. The indigoids (indigo and dehydroindigo) penetrate more in palygorskite than in sepiolite, and this penetration is favoured by thermal treatments (very efficient up to 130 &#176;C). The indigo concentration decreases monotonically versus depth, while the dehydroindigo one increases from zero in the external region of the crystals to a maximum at a depth between 40 and 80&#38;nbsp;nm and then decreasing rapidly. These facts are directly linked to the much higher resistance to acid attack of palygorskite&ndash;indigo pigments (Maya Blue) than sepiolite&ndash;indigo ones.",

The calculation of their performance by means of ray-tracing is useful for a rapid estimation of flux, resolution and focusing properties achievable in a beamline, when other optics are present, or simply to study the lens acceptance and focusing in the presence of a particular bending magnet, wiggler or undulator X-ray source. The ray-tracing method presented in this paper has been used to calculate the efficiency of beryllium CRL&#39;s using, for the instrument layout, realistic source size and divergence, and usual optics like perfect crystal monochromators. It is shown that the intensity transmitted by the lens, the effective aperture and the gain are in good agreement with analytical formulas. Additional information provided when running the program are the precise shape of beam at the focus, and at any position along the optical axis. For instance the intensity distribution at the CRL entrance and exit planes allows a comparison between the effective and the geometrical apertures. Finally, the method provides a precise value for the lens focal distance, which depends on the CRL length.",

In a contrary to the traditional backlighting scheme, in which the investigated objects should be placed between the backlighter and the crystal, for the considered schemes an object is placed downstream of the crystal, before the tangential or after the sagittal focus and an image of the object is recorded at the distance from the object corresponded to the needed magnification. The magnification is defined by the ratio of the distances form the sagittal focus to the detector and from the object to the sagittal focus. A ray tracing modeling and experimental images of test meshes, obtained at an incidence angles of the backlighter radiation of 10&#176; and 22&#176;, are presented. It is demonstrated that, at incident angles up to 22&#176;, a linear transformation of the obtained astigmatic images allows to reconstruct them with an accuracy (5 - 15%). A spatial resolution around 10 &#181;m in a field of view of some mm2 is achieved, for the spectral range around 9 &#38;angst;.

	abstract         = "The X-ray reflectivity of a multilayer is a nonlinear function of many parameters (materials, layer thicknesses, densities, roughness). Nonlinear fitting of experimental data with simulations requires to use initial values sufficiently close to the optimum value. This is a difficult task when the space topology of the variables is highly structured, as in our case. The application of global optimization methods to fit multilayer reflectivity data is presented. Genetic algorithms are stochastic methods based on the model of natural evolution: the improvement of a population along successive generations. A complete set of initial parameters constitutes an individual. The population is a collection of individuals. Each generation is built from the parent generation by applying some operators (e.g. selection, crossover, mutation) on the members of the parent generation. The pressure of selection drives the population to include &#34;good&#34; individuals. For large number of generations, the best individuals will approximate the optimum parameters. Some results on fitting experimental hard X-ray reflectivity data for Ni/C multilayers recorded at the ESRF BM5 are presented. This method could be also applied to the help in the design of multilayers optimized for a target application, like for astronomical grazing-incidence hard X-ray telescopes."}

	abstract         = "Many software programs are available on the market for the design of optical instruments. However, most of them are not suitable for modeling X-ray optical elements. The simulation of the X-ray source characteristics (emission, geometry) strongly depends on the type of generator used (synchrotron insertion devices, FEL, X-ray tube, laser- generated plasma, etc.). The optical elements are usually grazing mirrors, multilayers and crystals, with very different characteristics from optical elements used in other photon ranges. In addition, the reflectivities of such optical devices must be calculated taking into account tabulated optical constants. In the last years we have developed a new approach for creating a common tool for X-ray optics and sources modeling, lumping together small programs from different origins and authors, adding an unified X-ray database and gluing all this in a user-friendly and powerful data manipulation environment. The result is the XOP code which is now used in many synchrotron facilities. In addition to the first level calculations available in XOP, we have incorporated an interface to the popular X-ray tracing code SHADOW that allows the simulation of the complete beamline and produces accurate values of beam sizes, divergences, flux and energy resolution. I review the present state of XOP and the SHADOW Visual Interface. I then present the plans for a new version in preparation. Then I discuss new ideas and possible requirements for simulating the forthcoming X-ray optics for fourth generation X-ray sources."}

	abstract         = "The shadow monochromatic backlighting (SMB) scheme, a modification of the well-known soft X-ray monochromatic backlighting scheme, is proposed. It is based on a spherical crystal as the dispersive element and extends the traditional scheme by allowing one to work with a wide range of Bragg angles and thus in a wide spectral range. The advantages of the new scheme are demonstrated experimentally and supported numerically by ray-tracing simulations. In the experiments, the X-ray backlighter source is a laser-produced plasma, created by the interaction of an ultrashort pulse, Ti:sapphire laser (120 fs, 3-5 mJ, 10/sup 16/ W/cm/sup 2/ on target) or a short wavelength XeCl laser (10 ns, 1-2 J, 10/sup 13/ W/cm/sup 2/ on target) with various solid targets (Dy, Ni+Cr, BaF/sub 2/). In both experiments, the X-ray sources are well localized spatially (~20 mu m) and are spectrally tunable in a relatively wide wavelength range ( lambda = 8-15 AA). High quality monochromatic ( delta lambda / lambda ~10/sup -5/-10/sup -3/) images with high spatial resolution (up to ~4 mu m) over a large field of view (a few square millimeters) were obtained. Utilization of spherically bent crystals to obtain high-resolution, large field, monochromatic images in a wide range of Bragg angles (35 degrees &#60; Theta &#60; 90 degrees ) is demonstrated for the first time.",

We demonstrate by ray tracing technique and experimental testing that this system allows microscopy studies with image resolution better than the dimensions of the source, high magnification ratios, and great field of view. Microscopes using this model can be easily built using different micro x-ray sources, like conventional x- ray tube generators, x-rays emitted by laser generated plasmas or synchrotron radiation.

Several codes have been developed by different groups to either calculate, with high accuracy, some particular optical elements of a neutron instrument, or to give rough estimations of the whole instrument including simple models of the individual elements. Our goal is to create an optimised code for neutron optics using accurate descriptions for each optical element. In this paper we will analyse the existing models for treating mosaic crystals monochromators. We will report on the calculated and measured diffraction properties of mosaic copper and pyrolytic graphite crystals, which are two of the most commonly used neutron monochromators."}

Non-linear fitting of experimental data with simulations requires the use of initial values sufficiently close to the optimum value. This is a difficult task when the topology of the space of the variables is highly structured. We apply global optimization methods to fit multilayer reflectivity. Genetic algorithms are stochastic methods based on the model of natural evolution: the improvement of a population along successive generations. A complete set of initial parameters constitutes an individual. The population is a collection of individuals. Each generation is built from the parent generation by applying some operators (selection, crossover, mutation, etc.) on the members of the parent generation. The pressure of selection drives the population to include &#34;good&#34; individuals. For large number of generations, the best individuals will approximate the optimum parameters. Some results on fitting experimental hard x-ray reflectivity data for Ni/C and W/Si multilayers using genetic algorithms are presented. This method can also be applied to design multilayers optimized for a target application."}

The new advantages of well-known combination of a laser-produced X-ray plasma source and spherically bent crystal for the soft X-ray region backlighting scheme were experimentally demonstrated and theoretically modelling by ray-tracing package SHADOW. The X-ray source was produced by heating radiation of Ti:sapphire laser (120 fs, 3-5 mJ, laser flux density 10/sup 13/ W/cm/sup 2/) or XeCl laser (1-1.3 J, 10 ns, laser flux density 10/sup 13/ W/cm/sup 2/) with repetition 10 Hz at different solid targets (Mg, Fe, Ni, Dy, BaF/sub 2/). X-ray source spot size on the target was well localised both spatially (~20 mu m) and temporally (1 ps-10 ns, depend of used laser) and is spectrally tunable in a relatively wide range (6- 19 AA). High quality monochromatic ( delta lambda / lambda ~10/sup -5/- 10/sup -3/) images with high spatial resolution (up to ~4 mu m) and in a large field of view (few mm) were obtained for different wavelengths using the same spherically bent crystal. It was demonstrated at first time that the spherically bent crystals can be sufficiently used for obtaining high-resolution, large-field, monochromatic images in a wide range of Bragg angles ( theta =40-90 degrees ), thus spherically bent crystals are universal for very wide wavelength selection, what is very important for many applications. Obtained experimental results were independently confirmed by ray-tracing modelling for different radius of crystal curvatures, Bragg angles and linear magnification of images.",
