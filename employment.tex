\begin{rubric}{Employment History}
% \entry*[]
%     My professional activity is devoted to X-ray instrumentation modelling and research using synchrotron light. It involves three main fields:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Design, development, and use of computer codes in particular ray-tracing techniques for modelling X-ray optics with direct applications to the design of synchrotron radiation beamlines.
%         \item Development and use of data analysis tools 
%     specific for different synchrotron techniques (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, etc.).
%         \item Experimental activity study of cultural heritage. Several projects concern the structure and chemistry of the Maya blue pigment.
%     \end{itemize}

\textbf{Since 1990 I am staff Physicist at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). My professional activity at the ESRF is devoted to synchrotron radiation instrumentation and research. \inred{It concerns modeling and simulation of X-ray optical systems. My contributions in this area are exported and used worlwide, so I am recognised as one of the major specialists in this area.} I was on leave from ESRF in two occasions. I worked in 2005 at the Universidad Aut\'onoma Metropolitana (Mexico) on cultural heritage. In 2019-2020 I was employed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA, USA) to work in the upgrade of the ALS storage ring.}
