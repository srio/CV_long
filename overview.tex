\entry*[]
    My professional activity is devoted to X-ray instrumentation modelling and research using synchrotron light. It involves three main fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design, development, and use of computer codes in particular ray-tracing techniques for modelling X-ray optics with direct applications to the design of synchrotron radiation beamlines.
        \item Development and use of data analysis tools 
    specific for different synchrotron techniques (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, etc.).
        \item Experimental activity study of cultural heritage. Several projects concern the structure and chemistry of the Maya blue pigment.
    \end{itemize}
