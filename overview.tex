    \textbf{My professional activity is devoted to X-ray instrumentation modelling and research using synchrotron light. I designed, developed, and applied computational codes, mainly ray-tracing and wave-optics, for modelling X-ray optics with direct applications to the design of synchrotron radiation beamlines.
    I contributed with new algorithms for accurate modeling most optical elements used with X-rays (crystals, mirrors, multilayers, etc.). I was involved in characterization of these elements and use them for different synchrotron techniques (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, etc.). I developed new methodologies for treating computationally the partial coherence of synchrotron beams. I am author of several computer codes used worlwide for x-ray optics simulations. The algorithms and tools I developped are used in many synchrotron facilities and other X-ray laboratories. I also developed experimental work for characterization of optical components. I gained international relevance in other fields, such as clay mineralogy and cultural heritage.}

My professional activity is devoted to synchrotron radiation
instrumentation and research.

During my formation period (Ph.D. thesis) I worked at the Frascati (LNF-INFN) and Wisconsin
(CXrL, UW) synchrotrons. I specialiced in beamline simulations using ray-tracing, working with Prof. F. Cerrina, creator of SHADOW, and applying it to new beamline projects at Frascati. 

I joined the ESRF at its construction phase in 1990 with the mission to develop and coordinate the optical modelling and optimisation of the beamlines under construction.
My main activity is the conception, development, maintenance, documentation and training on
computer codes for scientific applications. I participated in the design of several ESRF beamlines and performed calculations for the optics of most ESRF beamlines.
I extensively used the ray-tracing code SHADOW. I actively participated in the coding and
documentation of this package, and I am its main curator today. I developed at ESRF a visual user interface, new algorithms and
created educational material (courses, tutorials, workshops). These are at the origin of present tools.

I was also involved in the development of data analysis tools targeted for different beamlines and
synchrotron techniques (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, etc.). I also used a
Monte Carlo radiation transport package for simulation on a multi-strip solid state detector and for
the calculation of dose deposition in Microbeam Radiation Therapy.
I collaborations with scientists working with thermal neutron instrumentation (ILL, France),
X-ray telescopes for astrophysics (Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera, Italy), and X-ray plasma
sources (Multicharged Ions Spectra Data Center, Russia; MIT and Princeton University). 

In the last years I worked in modelling X-ray instrumentation for new synchrotron sources (low emittance storage rings). I developed new methods for wave-optics and hybrid ray-tracing and wave-optics methods. With my Ph.D. student M. Glass, we applied for the first time the coherent mode decomposition to the undulator radiation, a useful tool for treating the partial coherence of these sources. I am co-author of the OASYS toolbox, a multi-purpose user-interface that lumps together many packages and models for optics simulations. It has been important for the design and optimization of the beamlines at ESRF and in many other laboratories. I recently worked at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory participating in several works concerning several beamlines for the upgrade of the ALS storage ring. 

I always wanted to carry out an experimental activity in parallel with the computer
modelling, and I proposed and run several experiments at ESRF and ILL. I am very interested in investigating technical and scientific developments in ancient cultures. In this context, I took a sabbatical leave in 2005 and joined the UAM as professor in the Physics depertment. I actively worked in the Maya blue pigment, a fascinating achievement of Mayan knowledge. I worked in IR optics, contributed to simulate a Raman Spectrometer. Also interested in the mirrors used by the early cultures, I also developed a project for tracking the provenance of obsidian used by the Teotihuacans, a material used for mirrors as metals were not known at that time.




% Since September 1990, I am staff member at the Experiments Division of the European
% Synchrotron Radiation Facility. All my professional activity is devoted to synchrotron radiation
% instrumentation and research.

% During my formation period (Ph.D. thesis) I worked at the Frascati (LNF-INFN) and Wisconsin
% (CXrL, UW) synchrotrons. Then I joined the ESRF in 1990 where I participated in the support
% groups (computing) to the design, construction and operation of the beamlines.
% My main activity is the conception, development, maintenance, documentation and training on
% computer codes for scientific applications (speci% collaboration (Mexico-France-Spain-Cuba) for applications in cultural heritage. I am currently
% studying the Maya blue pigment.ally modelling and simulation of physical
% phenomena, visualization, data analysis and fitting of experimental data). I give computational
% support for the optical modelling and optimisation of the x-ray optics. I participated in the design
% of several ESRF beamlines and performed calculations for the optics of most ESRF beamlines.
% I extensively used the ray-tracing code SHADOW. I actively participated in the coding and
% documentation of this package. I developed at ESRF a visual user interface, new algorithms and
% created educational material (courses, tutorials, workshops). These tools are used worldwide
% today.

% The computational needs for optics calculations at ESRF required not only ray-tracing simulation,
% but also a toolkit for performing quick calculations in an easy way, that could be used in an easy
% way at the beamlines. This was materialized in the package XOP, now a standard tool in most
% synchrotron facilities and in other laboratories, with more than 400 registered users.
% I was also involved in the development of data analysis tools targeted for different beamlines and
% synchrotron techniques (x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray fluorescence, etc.). I also used a
% Monte Carlo radiation transport package for simulation on a multi-strip solid state detector and for
% the calculation of dose deposition in Microbeam Radiation Therapy.
% The expertise I obtained in the synchrotron field has been extended to other fields, and I have
% fruitful collaborations with scientists working with thermal neutron instrumentation (ILL, France),
% x-ray telescopes for astrophysics (Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera, Italy), and x-ray plasma
% sources (Multicharged Ions Spectra Data Center, Russia).
% I always wanted to encourage and maintain an experimental activity in parallel with the computer
% modelling, and I proposed and run several experiments at ESRF and ILL.
% I am also interested in expanding the applicability of SR to new research areas. I have started a
% collaboration (Mexico-France-Spain-Cuba) for applications in cultural heritage. I am currently
% studying the Maya blue pigment.
