	abstract         = "The crystal lattice of single-crystal silicon gives rise to anisotropic elasticity. The stiffness and compliance coefficient matrix depend on crystal orientation and, consequently, Young&#39;s modulus, the shear modulus and Poisson&#39;s ratio as well. Computer codes (in Matlab and Python) have been developed to calculate these anisotropic elasticity parameters for a silicon crystal in any orientation. These codes facilitate the evaluation of these anisotropy effects in silicon for applications such as microelectronics, microelectromechanical systems and X-ray optics. For mechanically bent X-ray optics, it is shown that the silicon crystal orientation is an important factor which may significantly influence the optics design and manufacturing phase. Choosing the appropriate crystal orientation can both lead to improved performance whilst lowering mechanical bending stresses. The thermal deformation of the crystal depends on Poisson&#39;s ratio. For an isotropic constant Poisson&#39;s ratio, [nu], the thermal deformation (RMS slope) is proportional to (1 + [nu]). For a cubic anisotropic material, the thermal deformation of the X-ray optics can be approximately simulated by using the average of [nu]12 and [nu]13 as an effective isotropic Poisson&#39;s ratio, where the direction 1 is normal to the optic surface, and the directions 2 and 3 are two normal orthogonal directions parallel to the optical surface. This average is independent of the direction in the optical surface (the crystal plane) for Si(100), Si(110) and Si(111). Using the effective isotropic Poisson&#39;s ratio for these orientations leads to an error in thermal deformation smaller than 5.5%.",
